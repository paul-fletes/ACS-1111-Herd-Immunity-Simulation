Answer These Questions

Once you have successfully run a simulation, use your python skills to analyze the simulation results:

1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
3. What percentage of the population died from the virus?
4. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?

When you have answered these questions, please put your answers in a file called 'answers.txt' and commit this to your repo.
